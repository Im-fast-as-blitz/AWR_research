        Create Replay buffer.
        Parameters
        ----------
        size: int
            Max number of transitions to store in the buffer. When the buffer
            overflows the old memories are dropped.

        Note: for this assignment you can pick any data structure you want.
              If you want to keep it simple, you can store a list of tuples of (s, a, r, s') in self._storage
              However you may find out there are faster and/or more memory-efficient ways to do so.
